 **## Snippet Power Up in VS Code (Windows)**

**1. Accessing the Snippet HQ:**

* Open VS Code. Click on **File > Preferences > Configure User Snippets**.
* Choose the language for your snippet (e.g., JavaScript).

**3. Meet the Snippet Squad:**

* **Name:** The unique code for your soldier (e.g., "Print to console").
* **Prefix:** The secret keyword to summon your soldier (e.g., "log"). Keep it short and memorable!
* **Body:** The soldier's actual skills, listed as lines of code in an array.
* **Description (Optional):** Explains your soldier's purpose in IntelliSense.

**4. Example Snippet Soldier:**

```json
{
  "Print to console": {
    "prefix": "log",
    "body": [
      "console.log('test');",
      ""
    ],
    "description": "Log output to console"
  }
}
```

**6. Save & Test:**

* Save the JSON file after adding your snippet soldier.
* Close and reopen VS Code for the squad to assemble.
* Start typing your soldier's prefix (e.g., "log") in your code. They should appear in IntelliSense, ready for action!

Now go forth and conquer your coding challenges with your newly deployed snippet soldier!
